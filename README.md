# A uniquely backend-focused project

This project is quite different from the other work you'll find on my GitHub - as I worked almost exclusively on the backend, this repo is not really representative of my contributions to the project. If you're interested in my front end / full-stack work, check out my current project, [HubBub](https://github.com/jnweiner/HubBub), or the [Excursion Expert tour display service](https://github.com/excursion-expert/tours_service).

Building off of legacy front end code from the [Excursion Expert reviews service](https://github.com/excursion-expert/reviews_service), I built an entirely new backend for this service, optimized to handle webscale data and traffic - defined here as 10 million primary records in the database, and managing 1000 requests per second once deployed.

# Coming soon

Further information on my process:
* Database benchmarking
* Deployment using Docker and AWS EC2 
* Identifying bottlenecks with New Relic and Loader.io
* Horizontal scaling and load-balancing with NGINX
